## Executive Summary

**TenderGraph** is an open-source research initiative aiming to solve the "Single Bidder Anomaly" in the European Digital Single Market.

While public procurement data (TED) is theoretically open, the complexity of cross-border terminology and legacy formats creates a barrier to entry for SMEs. Current commercial solutions are expensive, proprietary "black boxes" that rely on simplistic keyword matching.

TenderGraph replaces this outdated approach with a **Neuro-Symbolic AI architecture**. By constructing a **Semantic Interaction Graph** of the entire EU market, we use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict business opportunities based on historical behavioral patterns, not just text matching.

## 1. The Challenge: Why This Matters

Public procurement in the EU accounts for 14% of GDP, yet it suffers from critical inefficiencies:

* **The Single Bidder Anomaly:** A significant percentage of tenders receive only one offer, indicating a lack of competition.
* **The Keyword Failure:** Traditional search tools miss ~40% of relevant opportunities because buyers use bureaucratic terminology (e.g., "Facility Hygiene Services") while vendors search for business terms (e.g., "Cleaning").
* **The SME Exclusion:** Small companies lack the resources to parse thousands of XML/PDF documents daily, leaving the market to large incumbents.

## 2. Technical Solution: Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic AI

TenderGraph moves beyond simple LLM wrappers. We treat the market as a heterogeneous graph structure combined with semantic vector spaces.

### A. The Semantic Graph (Structure)
We model the ecosystem as a graph $G = (U, V, T, E)$ where:
* **Nodes:** Buyers ($U$), Vendors ($V$), Tenders ($T$), and CPV Codes.
* **Edges:** Represent explicit interactions (wins, bids) and implicit semantic similarities.
* **Goal:** To reveal non-obvious relationships (e.g., "Vendors who win *Security* contracts often also win *Cyber-audit* contracts").

### B. Graph Neural Networks (Intelligence)
We utilize **PyTorch Geometric** to train a GNN (e.g., GraphSAGE/GAT) on the topology of the procurement network.
* **Task:** Link Prediction.
* **Input:** Node features generated by multilingual transformer models.
* **Output:** A probability score $P(u, v)$ indicating the "Market Fit" between a Vendor and a new Tender.

### C. Data Sovereignty & Privacy
Unlike cloud-only SaaS competitors, TenderGraph is designed with a **Model-Agnostic Inference Layer**.
* **Local-First:** Supports running open-weights models (Llama 3, Mistral) locally for sensitive data processing.
* **No Vendor Lock-in:** The architecture is not tied to a specific API provider (e.g., OpenAI), ensuring long-term sustainability and GDPR compliance.

## 4. Architecture & Stack

The system is built for reproducibility and scalability.

* **Ingestion Pipeline:** Robust Python ETL handling TED eForms (XML/JSON) standardization and entity resolution (deduplication of company names).
* **Vector Database:** PostgreSQL with `pgvector` for hybrid search (SQL filters + Vector similarity).
* **ML Engine:** * *Graph:* PyTorch Geometric
    * *NLP:* HuggingFace `sentence-transformers` (Multilingual MiniLM)
* **User Interface:** Streamlit (Python-based reactive dashboard).

## 5. Roadmap (NGI Zero Project)

This repository is currently in the active development phase, funded by the **NGI Zero Commons Fund**.

* **Milestone 1 (Month 1-2):** Release of the `ted-parser` module and core database schema.
* **Milestone 2 (Month 3-4):** Implementation of the Semantic Graph builder and initial GNN training pipeline.
* **Milestone 3 (Month 5-6):** Public Beta release with Streamlit UI and documentation.
